This project is an apartment complex system developed for “Yehulachen Real Estate” in Ethiopia. 
There are two modules in this system. In the site management module, real estate agents can obtain information about 
houses for sale or rent, contract information can be extracted, membership fee information can be viewed, and residents can request some services.
To conduct this project, data was provided via telephone interview. The crow foot model diagram of the project is as follows:

The project is still in the design stage so optimizations are yet to be made before implementation.
